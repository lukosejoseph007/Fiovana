# Incident Response Procedures

## Overview
This document outlines the incident response procedures for security events and system failures in the Fiovana application.

## Incident Classification

### Severity Levels

| Level | Description | Response Time | Escalation |
|-------|-------------|---------------|------------|
| **Critical** | System compromise, data breach, complete outage | Immediate | Executive team + Security team |
| **High** | Major security violation, partial outage | 1 hour | Security team + Engineering |
| **Medium** | Security policy violation, performance issues | 4 hours | Engineering team |
| **Low** | Minor issues, configuration problems | 24 hours | On-call engineer |

## Incident Response Workflow

### 1. Detection and Reporting
- **Automated Detection**: Security audit logs, system monitoring
- **Manual Reporting**: Users report via support channels
- **External Reports**: Security researchers, vulnerability disclosures

### 2. Initial Assessment
```rust
// Incident assessment checklist
fn assess_incident(event: &SecurityEvent) -> IncidentSeverity {
    match event.event_type {
        SecurityEventType::DataBreach => IncidentSeverity::Critical,
        SecurityEventType::UnauthorizedAccess => IncidentSeverity::High,
        SecurityEventType::PolicyViolation => IncidentSeverity::Medium,
        _ => IncidentSeverity::Low,
    }
}
```

### 3. Containment Procedures
#### Immediate Actions:
- Activate safe mode (`SafeModeLevel::Emergency`)
- Enable circuit breakers for affected operations
- Quarantine suspicious files
- Preserve audit logs and evidence

#### Emergency Commands:
```bash
# Activate emergency safe mode
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/emergency/safe-mode/emergency

# Enable kill switch
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/emergency/kill-switch/enable

# Quarantine suspicious files
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/security/quarantine --data '{"path":"/suspicious/file.exe"}'
```

### 4. Eradication and Recovery
- Identify root cause
- Apply security patches
- Restore from clean backups
- Verify system integrity

### 5. Post-Incident Activities
- Conduct root cause analysis
- Update security controls
- Document lessons learned
- Update this runbook

## Emergency Procedures

### Kill Switch Activation
The system includes an emergency kill switch that can completely disable file operations:

```rust
// Emergency kill switch
pub fn activate_kill_switch() -> Result<()> {
    let mut kill_switch = KILL_SWITCH.lock().unwrap();
    *kill_switch = true;
    log::error!("EMERGENCY: Kill switch activated");
    Ok(())
}
```

### Safe Mode Escalation
The safe mode system supports multiple levels of restriction:

```rust
pub enum SafeModeLevel {
    Disabled,     // Normal operation
    Restricted,   // Limited file types
    Paranoid,     // Only text files
    Emergency,    // No file operations
    Lockdown,     // Complete lockdown
}
```

## Communication Plan

### Internal Communications
- **Critical**: Immediate notification to all team members
- **High**: Notification within 1 hour to relevant teams
- **Medium**: Daily status updates
- **Low**: Weekly summary reports

### External Communications
- **Data Breach**: Legal and PR team involvement
- **Security Vulnerability**: Coordinated disclosure process
- **Service Outage**: Customer notifications via status page

## Evidence Preservation

### Data to Preserve:
- Security audit logs
- System logs
- Configuration backups
- Memory dumps (if applicable)
- Network traffic captures

### Preservation Commands:
```bash
# Create evidence snapshot
tar -czf evidence-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S).tar.gz \
    ./logs/ \
    ./backups/ \
    ./config/
```

## Recovery Procedures

### Configuration Recovery
```bash
# Restore from last known good backup
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/recovery/restore --data '{"backup_id":"latest"}'

# Validate system integrity
curl http://localhost:8080/api/integrity/validate
```

### System Verification
After recovery, verify:
- All security controls are functioning
- Audit logging is operational
- Backup system is working
- No residual compromise exists

## Training and Drills

### Quarterly Drills:
- Tabletop exercises for various scenarios
- Technical recovery drills
- Communication protocol testing

### Training Requirements:
- All engineers: Basic incident response
- Security team: Advanced incident handling
- Management: Communication and decision-making

## Contact Information

### Internal Contacts:
- **Security Lead**: security@company.com
- **Engineering Manager**: eng@company.com
- **On-call Engineer**: oncall@company.com

### External Contacts:
- **Legal Counsel**: legal@company.com
- **PR Team**: pr@company.com
- **Law Enforcement**: Local cyber crime unit

## Appendix: Common Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Malicious File Upload
1. Detect via magic number validation failure
2. Quarantine file immediately
3. Scan system for similar files
4. Update validation rules
5. Notify affected users

### Scenario 2: Unauthorized Access
1. Detect via audit log anomalies
2. Revoke compromised credentials
3. Reset all user sessions
4. Enhance access controls
5. Conduct security review

### Scenario 3: System Compromise
1. Activate kill switch
2. Isolate affected systems
3. Preserve evidence
4. Engage external forensics
5. Complete rebuild from scratch
